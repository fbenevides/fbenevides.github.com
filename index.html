    <p>I'm a polyglot software engineer and in the past several years (12+) I’ve been working mostly in backend systems and mobile apps, designing, coding and scaling some of the hottest startups in Brazil: <a href="https://99app.com">99</a>, <a href="https://yellow.app">Yellow</a> & <a href="https://ongrin.com/">Grin Scooters</a>.</p>
    <p>Most of the time, you will see me writing code in Java, Scala, Javascript, Ruby or Kotlin, but I’ve been learning Elixir in my free time (besides surfing, which is my passion!).</p>
    <p>Besides that, one activity I’ve been exercising a lot is team management. I truly believe that, when you understand the people of your team, focus on their strengths and help them to extract the best they can, we can achieve really amazing results for the company and for themselves.</p>
    <p>But let's have a coffee or a beer, I'm always open to learn new things and discuss crazy ideas. You can reach me at <a href="mailto:me@benevides.pro">me@benevides.pro</a>
